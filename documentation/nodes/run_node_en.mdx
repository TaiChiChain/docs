The steps to run an `AxiomLedger` node include:

1. Prepare the required environment
2. Obtain the node binary
3. Deploy and start the node
4. Connect to mainnet/testnet

# Environment Requirements
`AxiomLedger` supports the following operating systems:
- Linux:
    - Ubuntu 20.04
    - Centos 8
- macOS: Ventura

# Obtain Node Binary
Note that the `AxiomLedger` binary contains a hidden `secret` to ensure that only nodes with the same `secret` can
connect to each other. The `secret` is injected into the binary during compilation. To connect to mainnet/testnet
you need to download the official binary released on GitHub.

## Download from GitHub
Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/axiomesh/axiom/releases) of the `AxiomLedger` code repository, download the latest version binary zip file
for your operating system and CPU architecture, and unzip it in the deployment environment to get the AxiomLedger binary.

## Compile from Source
### Prepare Compilation Environment
- Install git.
- Compiling from source requires Golang environment above version 1.20, see [Golang Installation Docs](https://go.dev/doc/install) for details.

### Get `AxiomLedger` Code
1. Use the following commands to download the [repository code](https://github.com/axiomesh/axiom) and switch to the latest stable version tag.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/axiomesh/axiom.git
    cd axiom
    git checkout ${latest_tag}
    ```

2. Download dependencies.

    Use the following command to download dependency libraries.
    ```shell
    go mod download
    ```

3. Compile the binary.

    Use the following command to compile the binary. Note that `secret` can be omitted. `net` can specify
    mainnet/testnet configs, if not specified it defaults to 4-node local config.
    ```shell
    make build secret=${secret} net=${net_name}
    ```
    The compiled binary is located at `./bin/axiom`.


# Deploy and Start Node
1. Generate related config files to specified directory.

    ```shell
    axiom --repo=$WORKSPACE config generate
    ```

2. Modify config file.

    Config files are located at `$WORKSPACE/axiom.toml`. You mainly need to modify ports and genesis validator configs.
    Nodes connect via P2P DHT, so you only need to configure genesis seed node P2P addresses. For quick start you can
    use solo node mode, see [Config Docs]() for details.

3. Start node.

    ```shell
    axiom --repo=$WORKSPACE start
    ```
    To easily manage nodes, you can register `AxiomLedger` as a `systemctl` service:
    ```shell
    [Unit]
    Description=AxiomLedger Node Service

    [Service]
    User=nodeuser
    Group=nodeuser

    LimitNOFILE=500000

    WorkingDirectory=$WORKSPACE
    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/AxiomLedger --repo=$WORKSPACE start

    Restart=on-failure
    RestartSec=3s

    StandardOutput=journal
    StandardError=journal
    SyslogIdentifier=AxiomLedger

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

# Connect to Mainnet/Testnet
The default config generated from the official binary downloaded from GitHub already contains mainnet/testnet P2P seed node information. So after startup it will automatically connect to mainnet/testnet. However, before the governance proposal to add the node is approved, other nodes will reject this node's connection requests. The node can only join the network after the governance proposal is passed.
