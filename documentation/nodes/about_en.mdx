title: "Learn About Nodes"
---

`AxiomLedger` network consists of three types of nodes: `Validator Node`, `Proposer1 Node` and `Candidate Node`. The main difference between them is the `role in consensus`: Block Producer Nodes are special Validator Nodes that propose blocks in consensus, Validator Nodes participate in consensus voting, while Candidate Nodes do not participate in consensus but only synchronize the latest block data in the network (they also forward transactions). However, there is no difference in deployment and installation between them. This section mainly introduces how to deploy a separate development environment network and how to deploy nodes to participate in the mainnet/testnet.
