title: "Gas and Fees"
---

To prevent DDoS attack, all transactions that change the state of ledger will cost some gas. The gas fee calculation
is the same as Ethereum.

## Basic Description

Gas is a common mechanism in blockchains. The original intention of Gas design is to prevent users from DDoS attacks
on the blockchain system. The Gas model is similar to cloud computing, except that cloud computing charges by time
units, while Gas charges based on the computational resources consumed.

$$\text{Gas Fee}=\text{Gas Used} \times \text{Gas Price}$$

where, `Gas Fee` is the total cost that a user need to pay for the transaction, `Gas` is the computational resources
consumed during execution, `Gas Price` is the price per Gas unit.

## Gas Limit

Some smart contract may have infinite loop by accident, to prevent cost too much gas, users can set gas limit manually,
otherwise `AxiomLedger` will set gas limit to $10^8$.

<Note> important note: manually setting gas limit over $10^8$ will be ignored.</Note>

## Dynamic Gas Price

In our system, gas can not only prevent DDoS attacks, but also dynamically adjust for network conditions. We call this
model the dynamic Gas price model.

The dynamic algorithm is as following:

## Gas Price Bound

To keep the gas price fluctuating within a reasonable range, we have set upper and lower bounds for the gas price. In
testnet, the upper bound is 10000 `GMol`, and the lower bound is 1000 `GMol`.

As for initial state, gas price is set to 5000 `GMol`.
