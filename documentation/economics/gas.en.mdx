title: "Gas and Fees"
---

To prevent DDoS attack, all transactions that change the state of ledger will cost some gas. The gas fee calculation is the same as Ethereum.

## Basic Description

Gas is a common mechanism in blockchains. The original intention of Gas design is to prevent users from DDoS attacks on the blockchain system. The Gas model is similar to cloud computing, except that cloud computing charges by time units, while Gas charges based on the computational resources consumed.

<Latex>Gas Fee=Gas * Gas Price</Latex>

where, `Gas Fee` is the total cost that an user need to pay for the transaction, `Gas` is the computational resources consumed during execution, `Gas Price` is the price per Gas unit.

## Gas Limit

Some smart contract may have infinite loop by accident, to prevent cost too much gas, users can set gas limit manually, otherwise `Axiom` will set gas limit to 100000000. 

> important note: manually setting gas limit over 100000000 will be ignored.

## Dynamic Gas Price

In our system, gas can not only prevent DDoS attacks, but also dynamically adjust for network conditions. We call this model the dynamic Gas price model.

The dynamic algorithm is as following:

## Gas Price Bound

To keep the gas price fluctuating within a reasonable range, we have set upper and lower bounds for the gas price. In testnet, the upper bound is 10000000000000, and the lower bound is 1000000000000.

As for initial state, gas price is set to 5000000000000.
