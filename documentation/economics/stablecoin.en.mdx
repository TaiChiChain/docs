`Axiom` natively supports the stablecoin `HKDC` pegged 1:1 to the Hong Kong dollar.

Unlike other blockchains, `Axiom` natively supports the stablecoin HKDC, which is controlled by a built-in smart contract that is jointly controlled and maintained by multiple institutions. When users pay HK dollars to the institution, the institution will mint the same amount of HKDC on the chain.

To ensure fund security, the operating institutions will regularly publish fund status reports and be subject to inspection by regulatory agencies.
