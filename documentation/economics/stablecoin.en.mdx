`AxiomLedger` natively supports the stablecoin `AXM` pegged 1:1 to the Hong Kong dollar.

Unlike other blockchains, `AxiomLedger` natively supports the stablecoin `AXM`, which is controlled by a built-in smart
contract that is jointly controlled and maintained by multiple institutions. When users pay HK dollars to the
institution, the institution will mint the same amount of `AXM` on the chain.

Like `BTC` has a minimum unit `satoshi`, `Eth` has a minimum unit `Wei`, `AXM` has its own minimum unit called `Mol`.
We have the following conversion formula:

$$ 1 \text{ AXM} = 10^{18} \text{ Mol} $$

$$ 1 \text{ AXM} = 10^{9} \text{ GMol} $$

To ensure fund security, the operating institutions will regularly publish fund status reports and be subject to
inspection by regulatory agencies.
