title: "JSON-RPC Introduction"

Interacting with Axiomesh requires sending requests to specific JSON-RPC API methods. The RPC requests must be sent to the node and the response returned to the client using some transport protocol. 

### Introduction

Axiomesh APIs use a name-space system. All method names are composed of the namespace, an underscore, and the actual method name within the namespace. For example, the eth_call method resides in the eth namespace.In order to maximize compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem, Axiomesh currently uses eth as the namespace for most interfaces.

Access to RPC methods can be enabled on a per-namespace basis. 

### Convenience Libraries
While opting to directly engage Axiomesh through the JSON-RPC API is a possibility, there are frequently more convenient avenues available for dapp developers. Numerous JavaScript and backend API libraries have emerged to provide wrappers on top of the JSON-RPC API. By leveraging these libraries, developers can craft straightforward, concise methods in the programming language they prefer, which effectively underpin JSON-RPC requests. These requests seamlessly interface with Axiomesh, streamlining the development process.


### Compatibility
The current Axiomesh extends support to the Jsonrpc interfaces of the majority of Ethereum specifications. However, due to disparities in the underlying implementation logic, certain interface responses may diverge from Ethereum's conventions. Should any compatibility concerns arise, it is recommended to consult the specifications and usage examples of the specific interfaces in the left sidebar for resolution.
