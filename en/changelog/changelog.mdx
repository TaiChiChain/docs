# v0.1.0
Initial release version **Aries**, supports the following features:
- EVM equivalent API and SDK.
- Uses our self-developed dBFT consensus algorithm, higher performance and faster transaction confirmation.
- Supports built-in system contracts for easy chain management.
- Supports reliable message transmission between Ethereum.
- Supports on-chain and off-chain combined governance mechanism based on proposals.

# v0.2.0
The second testnet version **Taurus** introduces the following features:
- Ledger module adds the JMT tree and snapshot mechanism, enabling the querying and validation of historical states.
- Supports the epoch mechanism, allowing dynamic updates of certain parameters within the chain through epoch changes.
- dBFT consensus algorithm supports random rotation of nodes based on historical reputation and validator election during epoch changes.
- Ledger KV storage integrates with Pebble DB, while consensus storage integrates with Minfile to enhance query performance.
- Governance proposals enable dynamic addition and removal of nodes, changes to governance committee members, adjustments to gas price parameters, and node version upgrades.
- Non-consensus candidate nodes only synchronize data.
- Decoupling of the transaction pool and consensus modules results in improved performance.
- API layer supports separate rate limiting for read and write requests.
- P2P network switches to the gossip protocol, providing better scalability for large-scale nodes.
- Block synchronization mechanism supports verification of the correctness of synchronized blocks.

# v0.3.0
Contains the following features:
- Transaction pool supports price-priority block packing
- Optimizes interoperability between system contracts and EVM contracts
- Reduces the amount of data broadcast in P2P message broadcasting through data compression
- JSON-RPC interface supports trace and txpool
- Supports ledger management command line
- Optimizes the performance of query-type api
- supports synchronization mode based on state snapshots
- Refactors node key management
- Ledger module supports pruning mechanism, which can prune ledger historical states outside the pruning window at node runtime, thereby reducing the disk space required to run a full node and improving ledger read and write performance
- Ledger module supports generating and verifying state snapshots of specified blocks
