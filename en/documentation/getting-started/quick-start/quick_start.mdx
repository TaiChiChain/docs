title: "Your First Transaction"
---

This guide will introduce you how to quickly access and use the AxiomLedger blockchain. You can easily initiate transactions, mint tokens and view  block and transaction information through AxiomLedger’s explorers, I believe this will be helpful for your subsequent development on AxiomLedger.

## Wallet Configuration

AxiomLedger is an EVM-compatible blockchain, and any Ethereum tools you are familiar with can be used on AxiomLedger, such as Truffle, Remix, ether.js. You only need to have an account address based on Ethereum, and you can connect to AxiomLedger's Testnet through mainstream wallets (such as Metamask ) or SDK. The RPC address of AxiomLedger’s Testnet is: `rpc.aries.axiomesh.io`, and the chain ID is: `23411`, The token symbol is `AXM`.

If you are using Metamask to connect to the AxiomLedger for the first time, you need to add the above RPC address, chain ID, token symbol and other information to the network list. After connecting to the AxiomLedger, generally speaking, your account balance is `0` AXM. At this time, you can visit the AxiomLedger testnet faucet and fill in your account address on the page to obtain `0.5` AXM. The address of the faucet is: `faucet.aries.axiomesh.io`. ***Please note: within 24 hours, an account can only get AXM once on the faucet!***

## Generating Your First Transaction

If you need to learn more about AxiomLedger,such as want to get more information on the chain or initiate transactions on the chain, it is recommended that you use the official SDK (axiom.js) provided by Axiom, which is similar to [ether.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js) in usage.

```
// Javascript
// Setup: npm install @axiomesh/axiom
import { ethers } from '@axiomesh/axiom'

const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider("http://rpc.mainnet.axiomesh.io");

async function main() {
  // query the BlockNumber on AxiomLedger
  const latestBlock = await alchemy.core.getBlockNumber();
  console.log("The latest block number is", latestBlock);

  // send transaction to AxiomLedger : transfer AXM
  // step1. Create account variables
  const account_from = {
    privateKey: 'YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY-HERE',
  };
  const addressTo = 'ADDRESS-TO-HERE';
  // step2. Create wallet
  const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(account_from.privateKey, provider);
  // step3. Create tx object
  const tx = {
    to: addressTo,
    value: ethers.parseEther('1'),
  };
  // step4. Sign and send tx - wait for receipt
  const createReceipt = await wallet.sendTransaction(tx);
  await createReceipt.wait();
  console.log("Transaction successful with hash:", createReceipt.hash);
}

main();
```

## Minting a Token

If you have successfully connected to the AxiomLedger network and experienced the basic usage of the AxiomLedger official SDK in the previous steps, then you can minting your own Token on AxiomLedger. Generally speaking, this requires you to write or prepare an ERC20-compliant smart contract in advance, and successfully deploy it on the AxiomLedger blockchain, add the contract address to the wallet software (such as Metamask), then you can view your Newly minted token.

In order to reduce the difficulty of your use, AxiomLedger provides a simple smart contract sample, you only need to modify the Token name (example is TAXM) and account address in it. Of course, you can also refer to this contract to develop a smart contract that better meets your needs.

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

//Safe Math Interface

contract SafeMath {

    function safeAdd(uint a, uint b) public pure returns (uint c) {
        c = a + b;
        require(c >= a);
    }

    function safeSub(uint a, uint b) public pure returns (uint c) {
        require(b <= a);
        c = a - b;
    }

    function safeMul(uint a, uint b) public pure returns (uint c) {
        c = a * b;
        require(a == 0 || c / a == b);
    }

    function safeDiv(uint a, uint b) public pure returns (uint c) {
        require(b > 0);
        c = a / b;
    }
}


//ERC Token Standard #20 Interface

contract ERC20Interface {
    function totalSupply() public constant returns (uint);
    function balanceOf(address tokenOwner) public constant returns (uint balance);
    function allowance(address tokenOwner, address spender) public constant returns (uint remaining);
    function transfer(address to, uint tokens) public returns (bool success);
    function approve(address spender, uint tokens) public returns (bool success);
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint tokens) public returns (bool success);

    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint tokens);
    event Approval(address indexed tokenOwner, address indexed spender, uint tokens);
}


//Contract function to receive approval and execute function in one call

contract ApproveAndCallFallBack {
    function receiveApproval(address from, uint256 tokens, address token, bytes data) public;
}

//Actual token contract

contract TAXMToken is ERC20Interface, SafeMath {
    string public symbol;
    string public  name;
    uint8 public decimals;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    mapping(address => uint) balances;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint)) allowed;

    constructor() public {
        symbol = "TAXM";  // Replace the symbol with your own
        name = "TAXM Coin";  // Replace the name with your own
        decimals = 2;
        _totalSupply = 10000000;
        balances[0xc7F999b83Af6DF9e67d0a37Ee7e900bF38b3D013] = _totalSupply;  // Replace the address with your own
        emit Transfer(address(0), 0xc7F999b83Af6DF9e67d0a37Ee7e900bF38b3D013, _totalSupply); // Replace the address with your own
    }

    function totalSupply() public constant returns (uint) {
        return _totalSupply  - balances[address(0)];
    }

    function balanceOf(address tokenOwner) public constant returns (uint balance) {
        return balances[tokenOwner];
    }

    function transfer(address to, uint tokens) public returns (bool success) {
        balances[msg.sender] = safeSub(balances[msg.sender], tokens);
        balances[to] = safeAdd(balances[to], tokens);
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, to, tokens);
        return true;
    }

    function approve(address spender, uint tokens) public returns (bool success) {
        allowed[msg.sender][spender] = tokens;
        emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, tokens);
        return true;
    }

    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint tokens) public returns (bool success) {
        balances[from] = safeSub(balances[from], tokens);
        allowed[from][msg.sender] = safeSub(allowed[from][msg.sender], tokens);
        balances[to] = safeAdd(balances[to], tokens);
        emit Transfer(from, to, tokens);
        return true;
    }

    function allowance(address tokenOwner, address spender) public constant returns (uint remaining) {
        return allowed[tokenOwner][spender];
    }

    function approveAndCall(address spender, uint tokens, bytes data) public returns (bool success) {
        allowed[msg.sender][spender] = tokens;
        emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, tokens);
        ApproveAndCallFallBack(spender).receiveApproval(msg.sender, tokens, this, data);
        return true;
    }

    function () public payable {
        revert();
    }
}
```
If you already have a certain understanding of Ethereum, you can compile and deploy this smart contract on Remix. ***Please note: 1. Please select the appropriate Solidity version when compiling the contract; 2. Deploy contract through injected Provider - MetaMask, please confirm that the network has been switched to the AxiomLedger’s network and the account address matches your choice.***
![通过Remix编译&部署智能合约](/en/images/getting-started/quick-start/compile-and-deploy-ERC20-contract1.png)

Click the `Deploy` button on the page, check the transaction details in the MetaMask pop-up box, and click `Confirm` to send a transaction request to deploy the smart contract.
<img src="/en/images/getting-started/quick-start/MetaMask-confirm1.jpeg" width="300" />

After the deployment of the smart contract is completed, you can see the address of the smart contract, the calling method and other information on Remix. Copy the address of the contract, and select `Add Token` on MetaMask and paste it, and then click Nextto view the balance of your minted Token on this address.

So far, you have successfully deployed the ERC20 standard smart contract on the AxiomLedger and minted your own Token! Of course, you can also complete the deployment of smart contracts through the SDK. For specific operations, please refer to ether.js.

## Transferring  Tokens

You have completed the minting of Token in the previous step, now you can try transfer your token. Similarly, in order to complete and display the operation more intuitively, it is recommended that you choose the Remix+MetaMask to transfer your token. First create a new account whose address is used to receive the token, then call the `transfer` method at the bottom of the page where the contract was deployed just now (you need to pass in the address of the new account and the transfer amount), and confirm the transaction in the MetaMask pop-up box.

After the transfer is completed, you can switch to the new account address on MetaMask to check its balance, and verify that it has received the token

## Using Blockchain Explorers

AxiomLedger provides an official blockchain explorers - [AXMScan](https://explorer.aries.axiomesh.io). During the process of interacting with the AxiomLedger blockchain, you can view the block or transaction information of the Testnet at any time. You can learn more about how to use AXMScan [here](/en/documentation/getting-started/resources/resources#axmscan).
