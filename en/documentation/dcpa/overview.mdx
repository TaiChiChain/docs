The absence of privacy protection in public chains is one of the core factors hindering users,
especially enterprise users, from using and building blockchain-based commercial applications.
To address this issue, Axiomesh needs to provide users with powerful privacy protection capabilities.
Combining design principles,Axiomesh proposes the compliant and
privacy-compatible protection protocol DCPA (Decentralized Confidential Protocol with Auditability).
DCPA adopts a twin-token model in its overall architecture to ensure the composability and flexibility
of the protocol. It is based on cutting-edge cryptographic technology to ensure the security and privacy
of transaction content and identity while ensuring regulatory compliance. In the following section,
we will introduce our zkToken, zkDID.
