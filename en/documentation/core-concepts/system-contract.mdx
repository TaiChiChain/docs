System contracts are built-in contracts of AxiomLedger. The contracts do not need to be deployed and can be called directly. The calling method of system contracts is compatible with the EVM.

System contracts use specific addresses, with the reserved addresses ranging from 0x1000 to 0xffff. System contracts mainly include the following types:


| Contract Address | Name                                        | Description                                                                            |
