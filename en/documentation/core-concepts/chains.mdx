Chains refer to various distinct AxiomLedger environments in which development, testing, or production use cases can be undertaken.

AxiomLedgers accounts can be used across different chains, but the account balances and transaction histories won't carry over outside of the AxiomLedger mainnet. Understanding which networks are available and how to obtain testnet AXC for experimentation can be useful when conducting tests. Generally, for security reasons, it's not recommended to reuse mainnet accounts on testnets, and vice versa.

## AxiomLedger Mainnet

The mainnet refers to the primary AxiomLedger blockchain within the broader ecosystem, where all transactions with real value take place on its decentralized ledger.

The AXC price that the general public and exchanges deal with corresponds to the AXC on the mainnet.

## AxiomLedger Testnet

In addition to the mainnet, there is a public testnet. This is a network that simulate the ecosystem environment, where protocol developers or smart contract developers can use them to test protocol upgrades and smart contracts that haven't been deployed to the mainnet yet. You can think of them as a simulation of the production and assembly servers.

Before deploying to the mainnet, you should test any contract code you've written on a testnet. In decentralized applications that integrate with existing smart contracts, most projects deploy replicas to a testnet.

AXC on the testnet has no real value; hence, testnet AXC has no market. As interacting with AxiomLedger requires AXC in reality, most people obtain testnet AXC from faucets. Most faucets are web applications where you input a request for AXC to be sent to an address.
