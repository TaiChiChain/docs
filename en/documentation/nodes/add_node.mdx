After completing the content of the previous section, we have already run an `AxiomLedger` node. Here, we will describe how to truly integrate this node into the network.

## Preparing a Proposal

Enter the governance page of the [blockchain explorer](https://scan.taurus.axiomesh.io),
where members of the governance committee can post proposals to add new nodes.
Click `post a proposal` in the top right corner of the image below to create a new proposal.

## Node Configuration

The command `axiom-ledger --repo=$WORKSPACE config generate` used in the previous section will generate the configuration for this node,
which can be used to fill in the data for the node governance proposal. The configuration is as follows:

```shell
account-addr: YOUR_NODE_ACOUNT_ADDR
p2p-id: YOUR_NODE_P2P_ID
```

## Writing a Proposal

Select the appropriate proposal type `Proposal Type=Add Blockchain Node`, and fill in two key pieces of information according to your own node's configuration.
The `p2p-id` corresponds to `Node ID`, and `account-addr` corresponds to `Address`.

After completing the form, click `submit`.

Once the vote passes, the node can be accepted by the network.
