title: "Learn About Nodes"
---

`AxiomLedger` network consists of three types of nodes: `Validator`, `Proposer` and `Candidate`.
The main difference between them is the role in consensus:

- `Validators` participate in consensus voting.
- `Proposers` are special Validator nodes that propose blocks in consensus.
- `Candidates` do not participate in consensus but only synchronize the latest block data in the network
(they also forward transactions).

However, there is no difference in deployment and installation between them. This chapter will introduce
how to deploy a separate development environment network and how to deploy nodes to participate in the mainnet or testnet.
