title: "Learn About Nodes"
---

`AxiomLedger` network consists of three types of nodes: `Validator`, `Proposer` and `Candidate`.
The main difference between them is the `role in consensus`:

- `Proposer` are special Validator Nodes that propose blocks in consensus,
- `Validator` participate in consensus voting,
- `Candidate` do not participate in consensus but only synchronize the latest block data in the network
(they also forward transactions).

However, there is no difference in deployment and installation between them. This section mainly introduces
how to deploy a separate development environment network and how to deploy nodes to participate in the mainnet/testnet.
