title: "Node Requirements"
---

To ensure a smooth deployment of `AxiomLedger` nodes, please make sure you have the resources specified in this document before actual deployment.

## Hardware Requirements

To run `AxiomLedger` nodes, we recommend the following hardware resources:

- CPU:
    - 8 Cores 16 Threads
    - 2.8GHz or higher
- Memory: 32GB
- Storage: 2T SSD, at least 40K IOPS and 200MiB/s bandwidth
- Network Bandwidth: 1Gbps

The above is the recommended optimal configuration. The minimum hardware requirements are:

- CPU:
- 4 Cores 8 Threads
- Memory: 8GB
- Storage: 500G SSD
- Network Bandwidth: 100Mbps

### Why These Hardware Required

The hardware requirements depend on the transaction speed and storage requirements. The amount of data stored on the `AxiomLedger` blockchain depends on the amount of `transaction` data and `on-chain state` data (such as account data and contract storage data). The current requirements are derived based on a certain amount of usage on the blockchain.

## Network

When running AxiomLedger nodes, you need to open network ports on the nodes to allow other nodes to connect.

Keep the following ports open:

- 4001: P2P port for connecting to other nodes to transmit messages.
- 8881: JSON RPC http port for providing services externally. This port is optional to open.
- 9991: JSON RPC websocket port for providing services externally. This port is optional to open.

Keep the following ports closed:

- 53121/40011: Node metrics exposure ports. Keep them closed to prevent unauthorized node metrics inspection.
