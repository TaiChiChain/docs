title: 'Cross-Chain'
---

Axiomesh's cross-chain mechanism is applicable to all EVM-compatible blockchains. Axiomesh's cross-chain mechanism ensures not only the cross-chain transmission of messages but also guarantees the transactions' integrity when Axiomesh interacts with other chains or when other chains interact with Axiomesh for asset exchanges.

## Cross-Chain Relayer

The cross-chain relayer is a crucial component within Axiomesh's cross-chain system. Its primary function is to relay cross-chain messages from one chain to another. The cross-chain relayer consists of two parts, each with distinct roles. Only when both parts are committed can the cross-chain message be effectively executed on the target chain. This mechanism prevents the possibility of malicious behavior from a single point.

Axiomesh has its own officially maintained cross-chain relayers. Axiomesh recommends users or applications to use the official cross-chain relayers to ensure the security of asset cross-chain operations and the accuracy of messages.

## Cross-Chain Manager Contracts

The cross-chain management contract serves as the engine within Axiome sh's cross-chain system. When a user or an on-chain application initiates a blockchain cross-chain request, it must go through the cross-chain management contract.

The source chain's cross-chain management contract encompasses the management of cross-chain entities, routing for cross-chain types, encapsulation of cross-chain messages, and the propagation of cross-chain events."

The cross-chain management contract on the destination chain includes checks for the target of cross-chain messages, decoding of encapsulated cross-chain messages, and invocation of the destination contract.

## Detailed Explanation of Cross-Chain Process.

### Message Cross-Chain Process

Cross-chain message delivery is relatively straightforward. Users and applications only need to send the message they want to deliver to the cross-chain management contract. Axiomesh's cross-chain system will then relay the message to the corresponding contract on the destination chain.

The entire process of cross-chain messaging is as follows:

1. User or Application sends a transaction;
2. The transaction invokes the cross-chain manager contracts;
3. The contracts pack the cross-chain message and emit the cross-chain message event;
4. The relayer captures the cross-chain message event, and both services of the relayer send cross-chain message transaction to the destination chain;
5. The cross-chain manager contracts on destination chain get the transaction and unpack the cross-chain message;
6. The cross-chain manager contracts invoke the destination contracts and finish the cross-chain message process.

### Asset Cross-Chain Process

Cross-chain asset transfers are relatively more complex. To ensure the atomicity of cross-chain asset transfers, the messages for asset cross-chain need to wait for receipts sent by the destination chain. Only upon receiving a successful receipt, the assets from the source chain will be effectively locked. In case of a failed receipt or if the acknowledgment is not received within the timeout, the assets from the source chain will be returned to the user or on-chain application.

The entire process of cross-chain messaging is as follows:

1. User or Application sends a transaction;
2. The transaction invokes the cross-chain manager contracts;
3. The contracts pack the cross-chain asset message and emit the cross-chain message event;
4. The relayer captures the cross-chain asset message event, and both services of the relayer send cross-chain asset message transaction to the destination chain;
5. The cross-chain manager contracts on destination chain get the transaction and unpack the cross-chain message;
6. The cross-chain manager contracts invoke the destination contracts;
7. If the destination contract execution is successful, a successful receipt will be returned; otherwise, a failure receipt will be returned;
8. The relayer captures the receipt and returns the receipt to the source chain;
9. The source chain contract evaluates the receipt and executes instructions to either lock the assets or return the assets.

## Deep in Assets Cross-chain

In cross-chain asset transfers, the most critical aspect to be concerned about is the status of the assets at each stage.

Below is the state diagram of assets in cross-chain asset transfers:

When a user initiates a cross-chain asset transfer, the assets will enter a semi-locked state. In this state, the assets are recorded in Axiomesh's cross-chain contract but not fully locked. The next steps of the process require waiting for the acknowledgment receipt from the cross-chain message before proceeding.

When the source chain receives a successful receipt, the assets will be locked on the source chain. If a failure receipt is received, the assets will be returned to the original user or contract.

Axiomesh's cross-chain system also incorporates a timeout mechanism for transactions. When the assets in a semi-locked state on the source chain do not receive an acknowledgment receipt from the destination chain within a certain time frame, users or on-chain contracts can manually trigger a timeout rollback. This process will return the semi-locked assets back to the original user or contract.
