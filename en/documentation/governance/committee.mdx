The governance work is mainly carried out by the Governance Committee. Initially, the Governance Committee consists of members from several default configured institutions, which are recorded in the initial block. Subsequent changes to the Governance Committee will be proposed by members of the Governance Committee through a proposal, and then voted on by committee members. If the vote is passed, a new Governance Committee will be formed.

The Governance Committee is mainly responsible for chain-related governance work, mainly including:

1. Node Joining and Exiting: Vote on proposals for nodes to join or exit. The proposal will be accepted only if it receives a certain number of votes, allowing nodes to join or exit the blockchain network.

2. Node Upgrades: Vote on upgrade proposals. If the vote is passed, all the nodes of the chain will be upgraded to the specified version.

3. Election of Governance Committee Members: Elect members for the new term of the Governance Committee.

4. Economic-related Adjustments: This includes adjustments to Gas fees, changes in reward and penalty mechanisms, etc.
