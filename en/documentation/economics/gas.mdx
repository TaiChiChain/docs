title: "Gas and Fees"
---

To prevent Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, all transactions that change the blockchain's ledger state (non-read-only) require a certain amount of Gas to be consumed. The calculation method of Gas fee on `AxiomLedger` is similar to Ethereum's.

## Basic Description

Gas is a common mechanism in blockchains. The original intention of Gas is to prevent users from DDoS attacks on the blockchain system. The Gas model is similar to cloud computing, except that cloud computing charges by time
units, while Gas charges based on the computational resources consumed:

$$\text{Gas Fee}=\text{Gas Used} \times \text{Gas Price}$$

where `Gas Fee` is the total cost that a user need to pay for the transaction, `Gas Used` is the computational resources
consumed during execution, `Gas Price` is the price per Gas unit.

## Gas Limit

Some smart contracts may have infinite loop by accident. To prevent costing too much Gas, users can set Gas limit manually,
otherwise `AxiomLedger` will automatically set Gas limit to $10^8$.

<Warning>
  Please note: Manually setting Gas limit over $10^8$ will be ignored.
