## AXC

Like other blockchains, AxiomLedger has native Token `AXC`, which is controlled by a built-in smart
contract that is jointly controlled and maintained by multiple institutions. When a user interact with AxiomLedger,
he/she needs to pay some `AXC`.

## Mol

Like `BTC` has a minimum unit `satoshi`, `Eth` has a minimum unit `Wei`, `AXC` has its own minimum unit called `Mol`.
We have the following conversion formula:

$$ 1 \text{ AXC} = 10^{18} \text{ Mol} $$

$$ 1 \text{ AXC} = 10^{9} \text{ GMol} $$
