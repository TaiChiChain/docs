title: "JS SDK"
---

`AxiomLedger` JS SDK is forked from [ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js). Since `AxiomLedger` is an Ethereum compatible blockchain, so any Ethereum SDK can use it seamlessly. In the future, we will add more features such as governance in SDK.

## Install

Run the following command to install axiom sdk

``` shell
npm i @axiomesh/axiom
```

## Simple Example

Here is a simple example of usage:

```javascript
const ethers = require('@axiomesh/axiom').ethers;

const url = 'testnet-url';
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(url);

async function getBlockInfo() {
    // get the block info of genesis block
    const block = await provider.getBlock(1);
    console.log(block);
}

getBlockInfo();
```

If all goes well, you will see the following output in your console:

```shell
Block {
  provider: JsonRpcProvider {},
  number: 1,
  hash: '0xf337cec2ef21cb627e4523e40115d1ce91501ea328c6a54df94579c9cd8144d0',
  timestamp: 1692862825,
